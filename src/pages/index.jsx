                  A stand alone application that uses MySql as a database, Java in the middle and JavaFX as the front-end.
                  This application allows you to create an account and set categories in which you are allowed to alot a
                  precentage of your net income to. It then takes that information and creates charts and graphs that shows
                  how much of your money goes into each category.

                  This utility was made in a full stack JEE for use by the client services department to effectively compare
                  multiple client regions across different LPARS. This is achieved by running as400 commands to create an
                  overview object and then SQL commands to read in the data to java which then quantities and displays the
                  differences between the regions in a simple and user friendly manner.
